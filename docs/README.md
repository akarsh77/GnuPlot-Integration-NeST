# docs

This is the source directory for NeST documentation. The documentation is rendered
into a html page using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).

## Documentation generation

Ensure that you are in the current directory ([docs](.)) before running the
below commands.

First, install all required dependencies
```
$ pip install -r doc_requirements.txt
```

Next, build the html page containing the autogenerated documentation,
```
$ sudo make html
```

**NOTE**: For building multiversion docs, you can run the below command:
```
$ git fetch --tags https://gitlab.com/nitk-nest/nest
$ sudo make multiversion
```

You can run `sudo make clean` to remove any previous build files.

**NOTE**: Root access it required because sphinx `autodoc` extension imports
nest and nest requires root access.

`build/html` will contain the built html pages. Open `index.html` to view the documentation.
If you built multiversion docs, then the docs will be present inside folders like `v0.3`,
`v0.2`, etc inside `build/html`. Open `index.html` inside any one of these folders.
