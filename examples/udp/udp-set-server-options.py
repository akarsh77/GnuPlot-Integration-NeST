# This program emulates configuration of iperf3 server on two
# Local Area Networks (LANs) connected directly to
# each other. LAN-1 consists three hosts `h1` to `h3` connected to switch `s1`,
# and LAN-2 consists three hosts `h4` to `h6` connected to switch `s2`.
# Switches `s1` and `s2` are connected to each other.
# host 'h1' sends packets to 'h4' for 10 sec.
# At 'h4' output is reported at an interval of 1 sec.
# After 5 sec of the start of the program 'h2' starts sending packets to 'h4' for 10 sec
# which is reported at an interval of 0.5 sec.
